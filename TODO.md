# Open tasks

- Check, that for a calculation only one row can be selected, e.g. if there are two rows with values (battery)
- Check, that if you cancel the calculation, that it is really canceled
- Calc from row: Only works if you select at least two cells. Then it calculates all values including the last cell. This should only work if you have selected one cell?
- Calc selected: Calculates all selected cells using the formula entered. Whereby the formula differs from the formula in the other calculation. If you enter V - 100 here, it will not work. If you only enter - 100 it works
